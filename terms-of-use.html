</div><div><strong>II. CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT

</div><div>If you ever wish to seek any relief from us, you agree to waive the ability to pursue class action.
</div><div>If any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the App and the Services provided by the App or this Agreement, then you and we agree to send a written notice to each other providing a reasonable description of the dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. The notice shall be sent based on the most recent contact information. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, you and us will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the dispute, though nothing will require either you or us to resolve the dispute on terms which either you or us, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable with.</div><br><div>
