</div><div>Activity Information directly related to your use of the App. After you set the relevant settings on your device we may have technical access to your camera or Photos - to be able to save the files generated via the App to your device or to analyze the picture(s) you upload through the App. However, we cannot collect, store or use the pictures or files contained in your Photos unless you upload such pictures or files to the App or otherwise share them.

You may dispose of, use, share, otherwise exploit your User Content for your own purposes, inter alia, download it to your device, send it, make it publicly available, share via social networks or otherwise at your sole discretion and responsibility. However, any use of User Content is at your sole risk.
</div><div>If you use the avatar feature, you may also be required to select your gender or indicate which pet is depicted in the photos (cat or dog). This information is used solely for the purpose of obtaining more accurate results of image generation.
</div><div>Please make sure that you download and save to your device all User Content you need right after such content has been generated via the App (including User Content created as part of avatar pack feature), as we cannot guarantee that you will be able to access or download such User Content later.
</div><div>To learn more about the storage terms applicable to the User Content related to the avatar feature (as it is defined in our [Terms of Use]), please review Section VI of the present Privacy policy. Note that the User Content related to the avatar feature may be transferred to the third party service provider (https://www.astria.ai/) for the purpose of AI image generation.

</div><div>Contact Information (name, e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the email) which you may fill in by yourself when you contact us via email, support form. We collect, store and process it by our cloud storage provider (Amazon.com, Inc.). We use such information to respond effectively to your inquiry, fulfill your requests, and send you communications that you request and perform the requested services.
</div><div>Information That Is Processed Automatically
</div><div>When you use the App, some information about your device and your user behaviour may be processed automatically. This information is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form. We process this information on the ground of our legitimate interest in improving our App and giving our users the best experience. If we do not access such data we may not be able to provide you with all the features of the App.
</div><div>We use third-party automatic data processing technologies to analyze certain information sent by your device via our App (advertising or analytics tools). Some of them launch automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests, behavior, location or movements (see the list of data described below). Processing information through automatic data processing technologies starts automatically when you first time launch the App.
</div><div>Device Details. When you use a mobile device (tablet / phone / smartwatch) to access our App, some details about your device are reported, including “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device (but not your personality). Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third parties.
</div><div>What data can be processed:
</div><div>Information about the device itself: type of your device, type of operating system and its version, model and manufacturer, screen size, screen density, orientation, audio volume and battery, device memory usage.
</div><div>Information about the internet connection: mobile carrier, network provider, network type, IP address, timestamp and duration of sessions, speed, browser.
</div><div>Location-related information: IP address, the country code/ region/ state/ city associated with your SIM card or your device, language setting, time zone, neighboring commercial points of interest (eg. “coffee shop”).
</div><div>Device identifiers: Identity For Advertisers for iOS devices/ Advertising ID or Android ID for Android devices, user identifiers (if they are set up by the App’s developer).
</div><div>Information about the applications. Name, API key (identifier for application), version, properties of our App can be reported for automated processing and analysis. Some services also record the list of applications and/or processes which are installed or run on your device.
</div><div>Cookies and similar technologies. When you use the App, cookies and similar technologies may be used (pixels, web beacons, scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then sent back to the server each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will know how many users access specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies.
</div><div>Log file information. Log file information is automatically reported each time you make a request to access the App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your device. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record certain log file information, including time and date when you start and stop using the App, and how you interact with the App.
</div><div>Ad-related information. The following data might be reported about the ads you can view: the date and time a particular ad is served; a record if that ad was “clicked” or if it was shown as a “conversion” event; what the ad offer is about; what type of ad it is (e.g., text, image, or video); which ad placement is involved (where the ad offer is displayed within the App); whether you respond to the ad.
</div><div>In-App events. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record in-App information (tutorial steps, leveling up, payments, in-app purchases, custom events, progression events, method of limiting the processing of user data).
</div><div>Information provided automatically to advertising or analytics tools does not generally come to our control, therefore we cannot be responsible for processing such information. Please mind that some services are engaged in personal data profiling and may obtain information related to your personality and/or your device by using technologies that do not belong to our scope of responsibility. In case when your user ID is linked to your Facebook account, Facebook may use your device information in association with categorized data that were already recorded in its databases (eg. your age, gender or other demographic indication). We do not control, supervise or stand surety for how the third parties process your personal data, that might be collected by their own means (not through our App). Any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information should be directed to such third parties (see Section IV).
</div><div>Payment Information
</div><div>Our e-commerce provider (Google) is responsible for billing, processing and charging for in-app purchases, handles your personal information and keeps it absolutely safe and secure. This information is processed as part of the performance of the contract between you and us. We cannot access or use your credit or debit card information.
</div><div>You may access the applicable “in-app” purchase rules and policies directly from the app stores.</div><br><div>
</div><div><strong>III. THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.
